            <h2>Introduction: Rich Dad Poor Dad</h2>
            <p>
                Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, had 2 main influential fathers in his life. <br><br>

                Poor Dad was Kiyosaki’s biological father, a man who was highly intelligent and very well educated. Poor Dad believed in studying hard and getting good grades, then finding a well-paying job. Yet, despite these seemingly positive attributes, Poor Dad didn’t do well financially. <br><br>
                
                Rich Dad was the father of Kiyosaki’s best friend. He had a similar work ethic to Kiyosaki’s real dad, but with a twist. Rich Dad believed in financial education, learning how money works, and understanding how to make money work for you. Although he was an eighth-grade dropout, Rich Dad eventually became a millionaire by putting the power of money to work for him. <br><br>
                
                The book is written from Kiyosaki’s perspective of how Rich Dad went about making money and the mistakes that Poor Dad made. The first 6 chapters of Rich Dad Poor Dad make up about two-thirds of the book and discuss the 6 lessons that Kiyosaki learned from his Rich Dad.

        <div id="chapter1">
            <h2>Chapter 1: The rich don’t work for money</h2>

            <p>Oftentimes people misunderstand the title of this chapter, and mistakenly believe that it means the rich don’t work. In fact, the complete opposite is true. <br><br>

                Instead of reading the chapter title as “The Rich Don’t Work for Money”, what Kiyosaki means to say is that “The Rich Don’t Work for Money.” Note that by putting the emphasis on the word “money,” this section takes on an entirely different meaning. <br><br>
                
                The truth is that the majority of rich people do work very hard, but they go about it differently than most people do. Rich people—and people who want to become rich—work and learn every day how to put money to work for them. As Rich Dad says, “The poor and middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them.” <br><br>
                
                Kiyosaki also notes that having a regular job is just a short-term solution to the long-term problem (or challenge) of creating wealth and financial freedom: <br><br>
                
                “It’s fear that keeps most people working at a job: the fear of not paying their bills, the fear of being fired, the fear of not having enough money, and the fear of starting over. That’s the price of studying to learn a profession or trade, and then working for money. Most people become a slave to money—and then get angry at their boss.”</p>

        <div id="chapter2">
            <h2>Chapter 2: Why teach financial literacy?</h2>

            <p>The second chapter of Rich Dad Poor Dad explains the difference between an asset and a liability. Chapter 2 drives home the point that it’s not about how much money you make, but about how much money you keep. <br><br>

                An asset is something that has value, that produces income or appreciates, and has a market where the asset can easily be bought and sold: 
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Assets produce income</li>
                    <li>Assets appreciate</li>
                    <li>Assets do both</li>
                </ul>
                
                Conversely, liabilities take money out of your pocket because of the costs associated with them. When Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published back in 1997, Kiyosaki created a lot of controversy with this statement. 
                <br><br>
                That’s because by definition, a personal residence isn’t an asset unless it appreciates enough to offset the costs of ownership. On the other hand, rental property is an asset because it can generate enough passive income to exceed the expenses of operating and financing the real estate.
                <br><br>
                As Kiyosaki writes in Chapter 2 of Rich Dad Poor Dad, “Want to grow rich? Concentrate your efforts on buying income-producing assets – when you truly understand what an asset is. Keep liabilities and expenses low. You’ll deepen your asset column.”</p>

            <!--This div part contains the chapter 3 of the book-->
        <div id="chapter3">
            <h2>Chapter 3: Mind your own business</h2>

            <p>There are 2 key messages in this chapter.

                <ul>
                    <li>First, pay off your debts and start investing in income-producing assets as soon as possible</li>
                    <li>Next, stay financially healthy by spending your time (instead of your paycheck) and investing as much of your money as possible in assets.</li>
                </ul>

                
                Next, stay financially healthy by spending your time (instead of your paycheck) and investing as much of your money as possible in assets.
                <br><br>
                Kiyosaki notes in Chapter 3 of Rich Dad Poor Dad that most people confuse their profession with their business. In other words, they spend their entire lives working in somebody else’s business and making other people rich.
                <br><br>
                One of my favorite quotes from this section is: 
                <br>
                
                “The primary reason the majority of the poor and middle class are fiscally conservative is that they have no financial foundation. They have to cling to their jobs and play it safe. They can’t afford to take risks.”</p>

          <!--This div part contains the chapter 4 of the book-->

          <div id="chapter4">
            <h2>Chapter 4: The history of taxes and the power of corporations</h2>
            <p>
                When reading this chapter, it’s important to keep in mind that Kiyosaki wrote Rich Dad Poor Dad as a motivational book, not to provide expert financial or tax advice. <br><br>
                For example, Kiyosaki writes about the time he bought a Porsche and treated it as a business expense, using before-tax dollars. Buying a high-end luxury car when a much less expensive make and model would do could put an investor on the fast track to an IRS audit. <br><br>
                But putting the Porsche aside, the points made in this chapter discuss how to play the investment game smart. The rich understand the power of company structures and the tax code and use every legal means they can to minimize their tax burden. <br><br>
                Compare how business owners and investors with corporations such as C corps, S corps, or LLCs pay taxes to how most people pay tax: <br><br>

                Business owners with a corporate structure:

                <ol>
                    <li>Earn</li>
                    <li>Spend</li>
                    <li>Pay Taxes</li>
                </ol>

                Employees who work for corporations:
                <ol>
                    <li>Earn</li>
                    <li>Pay Taxes</li>
                    <li>Spend</li>
                </ol>

                Notice that employees who work for somebody else spend their money post-tax, while business owners earn and spend before paying tax. <br><br>

                “For instance, a corporation can pay expenses before paying taxes, whereas an employee gets taxed first and must try to pay expenses on what is left. . . Corporations also offer legal protection from lawsuits. When someone sues a wealthy individual, they are often met with layers of legal protection and often find that the wealthy person actually owns nothing [in their own name]. They control everything, but [personally] own nothing.”
