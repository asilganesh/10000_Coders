 <br>
 <p>Sadhguru’s latest book,<em> Inner Engineering: A Yogi’s Guide to Joy</em>,will be released on December 12, 2016. In this transformative book, Sadhguru draws from his own experience of life and introduces the revolutionary technology of Inner Engineering. Developed by him over several years, this powerful practice serves to align the mind and the body with energies around and within, creating a world of limitless power and possibilities.

    Inner Engineering is your personalized tool for joy and wellbeing. As Sadhguru explains in the introduction, “My aim in this book is to help make joy your constant companion. To make that happen, this book offers you not a sermon, but a science; not a teaching, but a technology; not a precept, but a path. It is now time to start exploring that science, working the technology, walking the path.”</p>

    <br>
    <p>Over 15,000 years ago, predating all religion, Adiyogi, the first Yogi, transmitted the science of Yoga to his seven disciples, the Saptarishis. He expounded on 112 ways through which human beings can transcend their limitations and reach their ultimate potential. Adiyogi’s offerings are tools for individual transformation, as individual transformation is the only way to transform the world. His fundamental message is that “in is the only way out” for human wellbeing and liberation. To create a joyful and peaceful world, humanity must know that true wellbeing can only be found within, and they must be inspired and empowered with the necessary tools to turn inward. The tools for transformation that Adiyogi offered to humanity thousands of years ago are not only relevant but essential today.
